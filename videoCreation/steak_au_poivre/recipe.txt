**Ingredients:**
- 2 beef tenderloin steaks
- Salt
- 2 tablespoons of black peppercorns
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1/2 cup of heavy cream
- 1/4 cup of cognac or brandy

**Steps:**
1. Season your beef tenderloin steaks generously with salt on both sides.
2. Crush the black peppercorns using a mortar and pestle, then press the peppercorns onto both sides of the steaks.
3. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.
4. Place the steaks in the pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or adjust to your preferred doneness.
5. Once the steaks are cooked, remove them from the pan and let them rest.
6. In the same pan, reduce the heat to low and add the butter.
7. Add the cognac or brandy to the pan to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits.
8. Pour in the heavy cream and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few minutes.
9. Place the steaks back in the pan, turning to coat them in the creamy peppercorn sauce.
10. Serve your Steak au Poivre hot, with extra sauce spooned over the top. Enjoy your delicious steak!

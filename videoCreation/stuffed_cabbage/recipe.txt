Ingredients:
- 1 head of cabbage
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 can of tomato sauce
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano

Steps:
1. Start by boiling a large pot of water. Carefully remove the core of the cabbage and place the whole head in the boiling water for about 5-7 minutes until the leaves are soft and pliable. Remove the cabbage from the water and let it cool.
   
2. In a bowl, mix together the ground beef, cooked rice, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and oregano until well combined. This will be your stuffing mixture for the cabbage rolls.

3. Carefully peel off the cabbage leaves one by one, making sure not to tear them. Place a spoonful of the ground beef mixture in the center of each cabbage leaf and roll it up, tucking in the sides as you go.

4. Place the cabbage rolls seam side down in a large pot. Pour the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes over the cabbage rolls. Season with a bit more salt, pepper, and oregano.

5. Cover the pot and let the stuffed cabbage simmer on low heat for about 45-60 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender and the flavors have melded together. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious stuffed cabbage!

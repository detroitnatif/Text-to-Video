Ingredients:
1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper to taste
2-3 tbsp all-purpose flour
Vegetable oil for frying

Steps:
1. In a food processor, combine chickpeas, parsley, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Pulse until everything is finely chopped but not pureed.
2. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the flour, starting with 2 tablespoons. Mix well until you can form a ball without it sticking to your hands. If too wet, add more flour.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, shape the falafel mixture into small balls or patties.
4. Carefully place the falafel into the hot oil and fry for about 3-5 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
5. Once cooked, remove the falafel from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.
6. Serve the falafel hot with pita bread, tahini sauce, salad, and your favorite toppings. Enjoy your delicious homemade falafel!
